### Node-forge ASN.1 Validator Vulnerability (CVE-2024-48939)

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (Preventive measures in place)

**Description**:
The node-forge library has a critical vulnerability in its ASN.1 validator that allows for non-synchronous interpretation conflicts, potentially leading to:

- Prototype pollution attacks
- Denial of service through malformed ASN.1 data
- Bypass of certificate validation
- Arbitrary code execution

**Impact**:
HIGH - Could compromise cryptographic operations and certificate validation

**Mitigation**:

1. ✅ Node-forge is **not currently used** as a direct or transitive dependency
2. ✅ Added package.json `overrides` to force node-forge >= 1.3.1 if it gets added
3. ✅ Configured .npmrc with audit settings to catch vulnerable dependencies
4. ✅ Security scanning workflow monitors for node-forge vulnerabilities
5. ✅ Regular dependency audits via GitHub Actions

**Affected Versions**:

- node-forge < 1.3.1

**Safe Versions**:

- node-forge >= 1.3.1

**Recommended Alternatives**:
If cryptographic or ASN.1 functionality is needed, consider:

- `@peculiar/asn1-schema` - Modern ASN.1 parser
- `asn1js` - Pure JavaScript ASN.1 library
- Native Node.js crypto module
